## The Beginning

My backyard space has undergone many changes over the past few years, from a wild mixture of elephant and wild grass, to a space containing a raised garden bed including a few trees to it's current incarnation which includes a few raised beds, a compost area, a _safe space_ half-barrel, several varieties trees and plants and a thoroughly mulched space with little to no wild grass.

\*\*\*Insert pictures of various phases here\*\*\*

Truth be told, not much planning went into the overall design of the backyard, I just planted whatever, wherever there was space <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Pk20jMIe44bHa" width="50" height="50" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>,

Despite this, there are still some interesting features of this space that I will discuss. This will also give context for the transformation that will occur in the coming months. 

## The Plants üåø

For such a small space, I have 16 varieties of plants in various levels of maturity (and health üòå) :

1. Several bananas trees (technically a [herb](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Banana))
2. Pomegranate Tree
3. Soursop tree
4. Two lime trees,
5. Four pawpaw trees (one male and tree hermaphrodites)
6. Several okra plants
7. Few scotch bonnet pepper plants
8. Lettuce
9. Sweet potato
10. Immature eggplant...plants
11. Few spinach plants
12. Immature [suriname cherry](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eugenia_uniflora)
13. Immature [mediterranean fig tree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Common_fig)
14. Lemon grass
15. (Too much) Basil
16. [Jack or Sword Bean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Canavalia_ensiformis)

## The Layout üìê

This backyard space is quite small, having a total area of x m^2. However, due to a large well occupying an area of x m^2, the total usable area is x^2m.

This area lies on the eastern side of the house and thus is shaded on its western side. This results in it being partially or fully shaded for ~6hrs per day, depending on the time of year. The eastern side is also partially shaded by the neighbors house, but to a much smaller degree. The backyard is open on the southern and northern sides. All of this is useful information for future planning plant selection and placement.

## Special Features üîé

This space has a few special features that are worth highlighting on their own. 

### Raised Beds

Firstly I have three raised beds, one 'twin' bed and a single large bed. The twin bed is enclosed using leftover concrete blocks while the large single bed is enclosed with scrap pieces of wood. All beds are filled with a layered mixture of dried grass, branches and leaves, potting mix, compost and topped off with dried grass as a mulch.

### Compost Space

I have created a composting space for my kitchen scraps, cut grass and garden clippings using a few discarded pallets. Composting is something so simple and useful that everyone should be doing it....[right now](https://blog.edisonnation.com/2015/08/10-benefits-of-composting/https://blog.edisonnation.com/2015/08/10-benefits-of-composting/). It's so important that I will do a whole blog post on itüò≤.

### Half-Barrel Bed

**Half-Barrel Bed**

Using a plastic half-barrel, I've created _safe space_ for  lettuce. This barrel is filled completely with composted kitchen scraps and full of worms and other creatures which in turn help to create delicious lettuce. An added benefit of this setup is that when watered, all of the delicious brown liquid dripping from the bottom is collected and used as a rich fertilizer for other plants in the garden.

## The End..of the Beginning

All in all, this backyard space will be transformed using permaculture and other agricultural techniques in order to improve yield, aesthetics ‚ú®‚ú® and to act as a showcase of techniques which persons can apply to their own spaces. 

Stay tuned for part 2 of this series where we discuss how we plan to transform this space.üôå
