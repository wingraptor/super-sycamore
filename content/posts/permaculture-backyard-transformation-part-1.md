My backyard space has undergone many changes over the past few years, from a wild mixture of elephant and wild grass, to a space containing a raised garden bed including a few trees to it's current incarnation which includes a few raised beds, a compost area, a half-barrel bed, several varieties trees and plants and a thoroughly mulched space with little to no wild grass.

\*\*\*Insert pictures of various phases here\*\*\*

Truth be told, not much planning went into the overall design of the backyard, I just planted whatever, wherever there was space. Despite this, there are still some interesting features of this space that I will discuss. This will also give context for the transformation that will occur in the coming months. 

## The Plants ðŸŒ¿

For such a small space, I have 16 varieties of plants in various levels of maturity (and health ðŸ˜Œ) :

1. Several bananas trees (technically a [herb](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Banana))

2. Pomegranate Tree

3. Soursop tree

4. Two lime trees,

5. Four pawpaw trees (one male and tree hermaphrodites)

6. Several okra plants

7. Few scotch bonnet pepper plants

8. Lettuce

9. Sweet potato

10. Immature eggplant...plants

11. Few spinach plants

12. Immature [suriname cherry](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eugenia_uniflora)

13. Immature [mediterranean fig tree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Common_fig)

14. Lemon grass

15. (Too much) Basil

16. [Jack or Sword Bean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Canavalia_ensiformis)

## The Layout

This backyard space is quite small, having a total area of x m^2. However, due to a large well occupying an area of x m^2, the total usable area is x^2m.
