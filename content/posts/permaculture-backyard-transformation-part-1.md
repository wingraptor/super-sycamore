  This is Part 1 of the Permaculture Backyard Transformation Project. In this
  post we will describe the current setup of the backyard; describing the
  current plants, trees and other interesting features.

## The Beginning

My backyard space has undergone many changes over the past few years, from a wild mixture of elephant and wild grass, to a space containing a raised garden bed and a couple trees to its current incarnation which includes a few raised beds, a compost area, a *safe space* ðŸ‘€ half-barrel, several varieties of trees and plants and a thoroughly mulched space with little to no wild grass.

Truth be told, not much planning went into the overall design of the backyard, I just planted whatever, wherever there was space. However, I believe that with careful planning using Permaculture principles I'll be able to:

1. Provide even more food for the household.
2. Experiment with different agricultural techniques and conditions.
3. Increase plant and wildlife diversity
4. Document  

*In order to know where you're going, you need to know where you've come from*. I'm going to adhere to this adage and describe my current set up. Leh go!

## The Plants ðŸŒ¿

For such a small space, I have 15 varieties of plants and trees at various levels of maturity (and health ðŸ˜Œ) :

1. Several banana trees (technically a [herb](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Banana))
2. Pomegranate tree
3. Soursop tree
4. Two lime trees
5. Four [pawpaw plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya) (one male and tree hermaphrodites)
6. Few scotch bonnet pepper plants
7. Lettuce
8. Sweet potato
9. Immature eggplant...plants
10. Few spinach plants
11. Immature [suriname cherry tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenia_uniflora)
12. Immature [mediterranean fig tree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Common_fig)
13. Lemon grass
14. Basil
15. [Jack or Sword Bean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Canavalia_ensiformis)

## The Layout



![Schematic of Backyard](/images/backyard-map.png "Schematic of Backyard")

This backyard space is quite small, having a total area of 100 m<sup>2</sup> (1076 sq.ft). Two large wells, taking up 6.82 m<sup>2</sup> in total, reduce the area usable for growing directly into the ground, however, these wells will be used in other ways.

The backyard is flanked on its western edge by my house and on the eastern edge by the neighbor's wall and house. This results in it being partially or fully shaded for ~6hrs per day, depending on the time of year. The backyard is open on the southern and northern sides which, along with the placement of the houses, acts to channel and accelerate winds (imagine a wind tunnel); an effect that is very noticeable depending on the time of year. 

There is a slight slope on the southern end which runs from South to North. This will invariably result in water and nutrient accumulation at the bottom of the slope and a deficit at the top unless techniques are used to minimize this effect. 

All of these properties will be taken into account in future planning, plant selection and placement.

## Special Features

What is a special feature? In this case, it's any particular aspect of the backyard that may be outside of the norm and will be discussed in more detail in other posts

### Raised Beds

![Twin Garden Bed](/images/twinbed-resized.jpg "Twin Garden Bed")

I have three raised beds, one 'twin' bed and a single large bed. The twin bed is enclosed using leftover concrete blocks while the large single bed is enclosed with scrap pieces of wood. All beds are filled with a layered mixture of dried grass, branches and leaves, soil mix, compost and topped off with dried grass as a mulch. 

### Compost Space

![Compost Area](/images/compost-resized.jpg "Compost area with three sections")

I have created a composting space for my kitchen scraps, cut grass and garden clippings using a few discarded pallets. Composting is something so simple and useful that everyone should be doing it....[right now](https://blog.edisonnation.com/2015/08/10-benefits-of-composting/https://blog.edisonnation.com/2015/08/10-benefits-of-composting/). It's so important that I will do a whole blog post on itðŸ˜². 

### Half-Barrel Bed

![Half-Barrel Garden Bed](/images/barrelbed-resized.jpg "Half-Barrel Garden Bed")

Using a plastic half-barrel, I've created *safe space* for  lettuce. This barrel is completely filled with composted kitchen scraps and is full of worms and other creatures which in turn help to create delicious lettuce. 

An added benefit of this setup is that when watered, all of the delicious brown liquid dripping from the bottom is collected and used as a rich fertilizer for other plants in the garden.

## The End..of the Beginning

All in all, this backyard space will be transformed using permaculture and other agricultural techniques in order to improve yield, aesthetics âœ¨âœ¨ and to act as a showcase of techniques which persons can apply to their own spaces. 

Stay tuned for part 2 of this series where we discuss how we plan to transform this space.ðŸ™Œ
