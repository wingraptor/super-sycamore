## Who Is De Plantuh Man?

As any Caribbean person knows if you want a truck, you call de truck man and if you want a taxi, you call de taxi man, so it's only natural that if you want anything to do with plants, you call....**De Plantuh Man**.

More specifically, **De Plantuh Man** can be described as many things with a single aim; to present, discuss and examine the many means and methods of growing food and other plants and _herbs_ in Barbados and the wider Caribbean.
