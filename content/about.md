As any Caribbean person knows if you want a truck, you call de truck man and if you want a taxi, you call de taxi man, so it's only natural that if you want anything planted, you call....**De Plantuh Man**.

More specifically, **De Plantuh Man** can be described as many things with a single aim; to present, discuss and examine the many means and methods of growing food, plants and _herbs_ in Barbados and the wider Caribbean. 

In order to achieve this aim **De Plantuh Man** will: 

1. Compare and contrast different ways of growing crops and other plants. Every type of agriculture has its place, and we will try to present each in a fair and impartial way.

2. Act as a centralized point for all things agriculture in Barbados and the wider Caribbean.There are many great projects, training seminars and other opportunities going right now in Barbados, but due to inadequate communication this information oftentimes doesn't reach relevant persons.
