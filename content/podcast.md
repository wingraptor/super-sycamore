## The Green Room Podcast

The Green Room is a podcast at the intersection between agriculture, business and culture in the Barbadian context. 

We hope to build a dynamic, diverse network for current and future generations to interact with and enjoy the inter-functional connectivity of the green revolution.

Stay tuned for our first episode which will be launching soon.
