## Rhymes and Reasoning Podcast

This podcast has been created as a space for the promotion of all things culture and agriculture. These include food, music, art, conscious rhymes and conversational 'reasonings'. The agricultural component will compare and contrast permaculture and other agricultural methodologies, green technology and agribusiness.

We hope to build a dynamic, diverse network for current and future generations to interact with and enjoy the inter-functional connectivity of the green revolution.

Stay tuned for our first episode which will be launching soon.
